JS-Tron is a browser based, Tron style game scripted in pure JavaScript.

It can be played as Player vs AI or as Player vs Player. It features an inbuilt mod page, accessed by pressing the "M" key, while not selecting any input, which allows you to mod each player's speed. The number of the speed is time in milliseconds between each move (the default being 80). This means the lower the number, the faster the player moves.
